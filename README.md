# Pattern_Detector or Sequence Detector
A sequence detector is a sequential state machine that takes an input string of bits and generates an output 1 whenever the target sequence has been detected.
##Type of State Machines:
### 1.Moore Machine
Moore’s machine is defined as a machine in the theory of computation whose output values are determined only by its current state.
### 2.Mealy Machine
Mealy Machine is defined as a machine in the theory of computation whose output values are determined by both its current state and current inputs.
